/* Creates a cache of objects, each of size size, aligned on an align boundary.
 * name identifies the cache for statistics and debugging.
 * constructor and destructor convert plain memory into objects and back again;
 * constructor may fail if it needs to allocate memory but can’t.
 * reclaim is a callback issued by the allocator when system−wide resources are running low (see §5.2).
 * private is a parameter passed to the constructor, destructor and reclaim callbacks
 * to support parameterized caches (e.g. a separate packet cache for each instance of a SCSI HBA driver). 
 * vmp is the vmem source that provides memory to create slabs (see §4 and §5.1). 
 * cflags indicates special cache properties. 
 * kmem_cache_create() returns an opaque pointer to the object cache (a.k.a. kmem cache).
